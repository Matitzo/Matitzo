I am currently studying surveying and cartography, but while taking classes 
I discovered that my new passion is programming. 
I am mostly self-taught. So far I've managed to create a few projects, 
which you can find on my profile.
I want to develop my skills in programming and maybe find a job as a programmer in the future.
