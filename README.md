I have a strong passion for AI and data analytics. My biggest project was my engineering thesis about use of Artificial Intelligence in GIS (Geographic Information System) enviroment where I trained a deep learning model for grave detection (getting their footprint with location on map).
 **Hard skills**:  
Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinker, Pygame),  
MySql,  
Machine Learning,  
Deep Learning,
Object Detection.
